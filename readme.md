# Overeat

A simple canvas game I made in 2023 that works great on mobile devices.

You control a blob that eats blobs that are smaller than you.
Beware: Larger blobs will chase you!

Tip: Use the world-wrap to your advantage. Blobs can't see past the sides.

# Highlights
- No deps (only uses vite to bundle/transpile)
- Virtual joystick
- Retina scaling canvas
- Mouths/eyes moving naturally toward player
- Food never spawns on player
- Scaling difficulty
